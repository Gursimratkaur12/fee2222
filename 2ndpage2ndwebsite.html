    <h3> "Overflowing manholes on Heritage Street leading to Golden Temple expose Amritsar civic body’s tall claim"</h3>
    <p>Stinky sewer water overflowing from a manhole brought forth the true picture behind the glitter of the Rs 250-crore Heritage Street project leading to Golden Temple. A short spell of rain led to waterlogging on a major stretch outside Jallianwala Bagh on Heritage Street. The manhole on the corner of Jallianwala Bagh also started overflowing after the rain.There is no separate storm sewer in most areas of the walled city. The rainwater drains out through the sanitary sewer. There was some issue with the sewer lines under Heritage Street as last year the sewer water had entered the trenches of Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) meant for the laying of underground cables. On Wednesday, after a short spell of rain, the sewer manhole overflowed for an hour and a major portion of the iconic Heritage Street was flooded with rainwater. The devotees were unable to walk with the stinky water around. Some shopkeepers put bricks in the waters for the convenience of pedestrians and visitors were seen walking on those bricks. “It is not the first time that Heritage Street leading to the sacred Golden Temple has been inundated with sewer water. Rain increases the flow of water in the sanitary sewer causing it to overflow. It causes inconvenience to the devotees as they have no other option but to walk in the stinky black water,” said Ravi, a shopkeeper on Heritage Street. “The rainwater used to accumulate on Heritage Street but now it drains out soon. Sewer manholes often overflow in the area, which poses a major inconvenience to the commuters. The Municipal Corporation should conduct desilting of the sewer lines around Golden Temple,” said Surinder Singh, an SGPC employee. </p>

    <h3> "CBI works under Centre, West Bengal Govt’s suit against its ‘misuse’ maintainable, says Supreme Court"</h3>
    <p>Holding that the CBI worked under the Centre, the Supreme Court on Wednesday ruled that the West Bengal Government’s original suit against the probe agency registering cases despite withdrawal of general consent under Section 6 of the Delhi Special Police Establishment (DSPE) Act, 1946, was “maintainable”. “In our considered opinion, the contentions raised by the defendant (Union of India) do not merit acceptance…The preliminary objection is, therefore, rejected,” a Bench of Justices BR Gavai and Sandeep Mehta said. The Bench, however, clarified that the findings were for deciding preliminary objections and would have no bearing on the merits of the suit.</p>

    <h3> "Snow cover in Himachal Pradesh’s four river basins declines by 12.7%"</h3>
    <p>There has been an average decline of 12.72 per cent in the snow cover in the river basins of the Chenab, Ravi, Beas and the Sutlej in the Himalayas during 2023-24 as compared to a decline of 14.05 per cent during the last winter.Though there has been a decline in the snow cover this winter, it was relatively less as compared to the winter of 2022-23. However, the Ravi basin has shown a marginal increase in the area under snow during 2023-24. The findings are based on the satellite imagery studies undertaken by the State Centre on Climate Change under the aegis of the HP Council for Science Technology and Environment (HIMCOSTE). As per the studies to assess the winter precipitation in the form of snow, the maximum decline of 15.39 per cent this winter was witnessed in the Chenab basin, followed by 12.45 per cent in the Sutlej basin, 9.89 per cent in the Ravi basin and 7.65 per cent in the Beas basin.What is worrisome is the highest decline in the snow cover in January; the dip was 67 per cent in the Sutlej basin, 64 per cent in the Ravi basin, 43 per cent in the Beas basin and 42 per cent in the Chenab basin, as compared to the previous year’s winter. The snow cover in February and March showed a positive trend in all basins. --> </p>

    <h3>"Police in India cannot register harassment cases for incidents abroad: Punjab and Haryana High Court"</h3>
    <p>The Punjab and Haryana High Court has ruled that the Bathinda police could not have registered a dowry harassment case against a family in India as the incident was alleged to have occurred in the US. The judgment is liable to change the way NRI women get cases registered against their in-laws back home, with the High Court making it clear that the police in India lacked jurisdiction to probe alleged incidents of harassment abroad.Justice Harpreet Singh Brar of the High Court also made it clear that criminal prosecution in India required sanction from the central government in cases where an alleged offence was committed outside the country in accordance with Section 188 of the CrPC.“In order to engage an investigating agency to inquire into the alleged offence, the territorial jurisdiction must be established, failing which would render the FIR to be not maintainable,” Justice Brar asserted, while hearing a petition filed against the State of Punjab and other respondents by a husband and his family.They were, through counsel RS Bajaj, Sidakjit Singh Bajaj and Sachin Kalia, seeking the quashing of an FIR registered in March 2020 for criminal breach of trust and subjecting a married woman to cruelty under Sections 406 and 498-A of the Indian Penal Code at NRI police station in Bathinda district. Directions were also sought for quashing all subsequent proceedings. --></p>
